# Setting Up Docker Hub Push for GitHub Actions

## Current Status
‚úÖ **Build with SBOM/Provenance**: Works without credentials  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Push to Docker Hub**: Requires setup (optional)

## Quick Setup (Optional)

If you want to automatically push images to Docker Hub via GitHub Actions:

### 1. Create Docker Hub Access Token
1. Go to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Go to **Account Settings** ‚Üí **Security** ‚Üí **New Access Token**
4. Create a token with **Read, Write, Delete** permissions
5. Copy the generated token (you won't see it again)

### 2. Configure GitHub Secrets
1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/langazov/docker-freeradius`
2. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret** and add:
   - **Name**: `DOCKER_USERNAME`
   - **Value**: Your Docker Hub username (`langazov`)
4. Click **New repository secret** and add:
   - **Name**: `DOCKER_PASSWORD` 
   - **Value**: The access token you created in step 1 (NOT your Docker Hub password)

### 3. Test the Setup
1. Push a commit to the `master` branch
2. Check the **Actions** tab in your repository
3. The workflow should now build AND push the image with attestations

## What Happens Without Setup?

**Without Docker Hub credentials configured:**
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions will still run successfully
- ‚úÖ Images are built with SBOM and provenance locally
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Images are NOT pushed to Docker Hub
- ‚úÖ All security attestations are still generated
- ‚úÖ Build completes without errors

**With Docker Hub credentials configured:**
- ‚úÖ Everything above, PLUS:
- ‚úÖ Images are automatically pushed to Docker Hub
- ‚úÖ Public images include SBOM and provenance attestations
- ‚úÖ Build attestations are attached to the registry

## Alternative: Local Building

You can always build and push manually using the provided script:

```bash
# Build locally with attestations (no push)
docker buildx build --sbom=true --provenance=true --tag langazov/freeradius:latest .

# Build and push manually (requires docker login)
./build-secure.sh
```

## Security Note

The workflow is designed to be secure:
- Only runs on the `langazov` repository
- Only pushes when proper credentials are available  
- Never exposes credentials in logs
- Uses Docker Hub access tokens (not passwords)
- Includes proper attestation generation

Your security setup is complete whether you choose to push to Docker Hub or not! üîí

## Troubleshooting

### "Username and password required" Error
This means the GitHub secrets are not configured. The workflow will still build successfully but won't push to Docker Hub.

**Solution**: Follow the setup steps above, or the workflow will continue to work in "build-only" mode.

### "Login succeeded but push failed" 
Check that your Docker Hub access token has **Write** permissions.

### Workflow runs but doesn't push
Verify:
1. You're pushing to the `master` branch (not a PR)
2. The repository owner is `langazov`
3. Both `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` secrets are set
4. The secrets contain the correct values

### View Build Logs  
Go to your repository ‚Üí **Actions** tab ‚Üí Click on the latest workflow run to see detailed logs.
